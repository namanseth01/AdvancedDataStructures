-> There is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in tree.
-> A tree with n vertices has exactly (n-1) edges.
-> A graph is a tree if and only if it is minimally connected.
-> Any connected graph with n vertices and (n-1) edges is a tree.

-> The first node from where the tree originates is called as a root node.

Edge:
-> The connecting link between two nodes is called as an edge.

Parent:
-> The node which has a branch from it to any other node is called as a parent node.
