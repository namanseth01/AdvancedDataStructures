Properties:
-> There is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in tree.
-> A tree with n vertices has exactly (n-1) edges.
-> A graph is a tree if and only if it is minimally connected.
-> Any connected graph with n vertices and (n-1) edges is a tree.


Root:
-> The first node from where the tree originates is called as a root node.

Edge:
-> The connecting link between two nodes is called as an edge.

Parent:
-> The node which has a branch from it to any other node is called as a parent node.
-> The node which has one or more children is called as parent node.
-> In tree, a parent node can have any number of child nodes.

Child:
-> The node which is a descendant of some node is called child node.
-> All the nodes except root node are child nodes.

Siblings:
-> Node which belong to the same parent  are called sibling nodes.
-> NOdes with the same parent are sibling nodes.

Degree:
-> Degree of node is the total number of children of that node.
-> Degree of tree is the highest degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree.

Internal node:
-> The node which has at least one child is called as an internal node.
-> Also  known as non-terminal node.
-> Every non-leaf node is an internal node.

Leaf node:
-> The node which does not have any child is called as leaf node.
-> Also known as External nodes or Terminal nodes.

Level:
-> In a tree, each step from top to bottom is called as level of tree.
-> The level count starts with 0 by default, and increments  by 1 at each level.

Height:
-> Total number of edges that lies on the longest path from any leaf node to a particular node is called as height of that node.
-> Height of a tree is the height of that node.
-> Height of all leaf nodes = 0.

Depth:
-> Total number of edges from root node to a particular node is called as depth of that node.
-> Depth of the tree is the total number of edges from root node to leaf node in the longest path.
-> Depth of root node = 0.

Subtree:
-> In a tree, each child from a node forms a  sub-tree recursively.
-> Every child node forms a sub - tree on its parent node.
